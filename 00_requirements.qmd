It is much easier to create, manage and co-develop an `R` package when you incorporate it into a distributed version control system like [git](https://git-scm.com). The extension to a software development hosting service like [GitHub](https://github.com) is then a natural one. Although there are other procedures and [DevOps](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/DevOps#Noun) systems and hosting services that may lend itself for package development, we outline the workflow with `git` and `GitHub`. We also assume that you have [`RStudio`](https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio/) available (installed or online).

## `R` and RStudio

**Using RStudio** <br>
RStudio is an R user's best friend. The IDE provides an enhanced interface for coding in R, with built-in support for markdown languages and R package development. If you're not familiar with R or RStudio, or need a refresher, please follow the tutorial in our [crash course](https://hanneoberman.github.io/R101/) before continuing.

## `git` and GitHub

**Using `Git`**<br>
`Git` is a free and open source version control system for text files. It can handle extensive change logging for you, no matter the size of the project. `Git` is fast and efficient, but its effectiveness depends also on the frequency you instruct it to log your project's changes. 

You can see `Git` as a blank canvas that starts at a certain point in time. Every time you (or others) instruct `Git` to log any changes that have been made, `Git` adds the changes that are made to this canvas. We call the changes to the canvas [`commits`](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#commit). With every `commit` an extensive log is created that includes at least the following information:

- the changes made
- who made the changes
- metadata
- a small piece of text that describe the changes made

The difference between two commits - or the changes between them - are called [`diffs`](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#diff). 

If you'd like to know much more about `Git`, [this online book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) is a very good resource. If you'd like to practice with the command line interface [use this webpage](https://learngitbranching.js.org) for a quick course. [This book](https://happygitwithr.com) covers pretty much everything you need to marry `Git` and `R`. 

**Using GitHub**<br>
`GitHub` is the social and user interface to `Git` that allows you to work in [repositories](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#repository). These repositories can be seen as project folders in which you publish your work, but you can also use them as test sites for development, testing, etcetera. There is a distinction between [private repositories](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#private-repository) (only for you and those you grant access) and public repositories (visible for everyone). 

Your public repositories can be viewed and [forked](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#fork) by everyone. `Forking` is when other people create a copy of your repository on their own account. This allows them to work on a repository without affecting the `master`. You can also do this yourself, but then the process is called [`branching`](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#branch) instead of forking. If you create a copy of a repository that is offline, the process is called [`cloning`](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#clone). 

`GitHub`'s ability to branch, fork and clone is very useful as it allows other people and yourself to experiment on (the code in) a repository before any definitive changes are [`merged`](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#merge) with the `master`. If you're working in a forked repository, you can submit a [`pull request`](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#pull-request) to the repository collaborators to accept (or reject) any suggested changes.

## System requirements

Installation of R and RStudio *or* login online on Posit Cloud.

::: {.callout-note icon=false collapse="true"}

## `R` and RStudio on your own laptop

**1. Check R version (you will need version 4.1 or higher)**

```{r}
R.version$version.string
```

**2. Check installation of R packages**

You will need the R packages `devtools` and `dplyr`. You can verify whether all packages are installed correctly by running:

```{r}
all(c("devtools", "dplyr", "roxygen2", "usethis", "testthat") %in% rownames(installed.packages()))
```

If not yet installed, run:

```{r}
#| eval: false
install.packages(c("devtools", "dplyr", "roxygen2", "usethis", "testthat"))
```

## `R` and RStudio online

**1. Go to [https://posit.cloud/](https://posit.cloud/) and click on "Sign Up" in the top-right corner.**

**2. Select "Cloud free" by clicking "Learn more" and sign up.**

**3. Go to [https://docs.posit.co/cloud/get_started/](https://docs.posit.co/cloud/get_started/) and follow the instructions up to and including "Create a Project"**

**4. Install the necessary R packages**
```{r}
#| eval: false
install.packages(c("devtools", "dplyr"))
```

Installing `git`, and the benefits of GitHub for R package development.

::: {.callout-note icon=false collapse="true"}

## Installing `git` on Mac

  I suggest you install `Git` by downloading and installing [`GitHub   Desktop`](https://desktop.github.com). `GitHub`'s desktop application is a nice GUI and, naturally,   integrates well into the repository workflow on `GitHub`. 
  
  When installed, you can go to `GitHub Desktop > Install Command Line Tool`
  
  After a reboot, all should be set.

## Installing `git` on Windows

  Download and install [`Git for Windows`](https://gitforwindows.org), Then download and install [`GitHub   Desktop`](https://desktop.github.com). `GitHub`'s desktop application is a nice GUI and, naturally,   integrates well into the repository workflow on `GitHub`. 
  
  After a reboot, all should be set.

## Using GitHub

  **GitHub for R package development**<br>
  `GitHub` is the social and user interface to `Git` that allows you to work in   [repositories](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#repository). These repositories can be   seen as project folders in which you publish your work, but you can also use them as test sites for   development, testing, etcetera. There is a distinction between [private   repositories](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#private-repository) (only for you and   those you grant access) and public repositories (visible for everyone). 
  
  Your public repositories can be viewed and   [forked](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#fork) by everyone. `Forking` is when other   people create a copy of your repository on their own account. This allows them to work on a repository   without affecting the `master`. You can also do this yourself, but then the process is called   [`branching`](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#branch) instead of forking. If you   create a copy of a repository that is offline, the process is called   [`cloning`](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#clone). 
  
  `GitHub`'s ability to branch, fork and clone is very useful as it allows other people and yourself to   experiment on (the code in) a repository before any definitive changes are   [`merged`](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#merge) with the `master`. If you're   working in a forked repository, you can submit a [`pull   request`](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#pull-request) to the repository   collaborators to accept (or reject) any suggested changes. 
  
  For now, this may be confusing, but I hope you recognize the benefits `GitHub` can have on the process   of development and bug-fixing. For example, the most up-to-date version of the `mice` package in `R`   can be directly installed from the `mice` repository with the following code   `devtools::install_github(repo = "amices/mice")`.
  
  You can see that this process requires package `devtools` that expands the `R` functionality with   essential development tools. Loading packages in `R` directly from their respective `GitHub`   repositories, allows you to obtain the latest - often improved and less buggy - iteration of that   software even before it is published on [`CRAN`](https://cran.r-project.org). 
  
  **Opening an account**<br>
  Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and sign up. You may qualify for a free PRO subscription through   GitHub's [education benefits](https://education.github.com/benefits).
