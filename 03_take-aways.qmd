Now you know how to build and share an R package.

::: {.column width="70%"}

Potential next steps include:

- Creating package documentation (e.g. vignettes)
- Creating a hex logo (e.g. with [`hexmake`](https://connect.thinkr.fr/hexmake/))
- Creating a package website (e.g. with [`pkgdown`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/))
- Checking the FAIR-ness of your package (e.g. with [`howfairis`](https://pypi.org/project/howfairis/), or [BadgeApp](https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/en))
- Checking the code coverage of your package (e.g. with [Codecov](https://about.codecov.io/))
- Maintaining the package (e.g. with [GitHub issues](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues))
- Maintaining contributions (e.g. with [a code of conduct](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/adding-a-code-of-conduct-to-your-project))
